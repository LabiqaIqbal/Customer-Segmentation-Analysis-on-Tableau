# Customer Spending & Segmentation Analysis – Tableau Dashboard  

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes customer spending behavior using an interactive Tableau dashboard.  
The dataset includes details such as **age, gender, income, spending score, membership years, purchase frequency, preferred category, and last purchase amount**.  
The goal was to identify spending patterns, segment customers, and generate actionable insights for marketing and business strategy.  

The project demonstrates the complete analytics workflow — from data cleaning and transformation in Tableau to visual storytelling and insight generation.  

## Objective  
To analyse and visualise customer spending patterns based on **income levels, product preferences, and retention trends** to provide actionable business insights.
The dashboard aims to answer key business questions such as:  
- How does income affect spending?  
- Which product categories attract high-spending customers?  
- Do long-term customers spend more over time?  
- How can businesses segment customers for targeted marketing?

## Key Insights from the Dashboard  

**Low-income customers (<20 years old) have the highest spending score (57.3), while high-income customers (Above 40) spend the least (45.6).**  
**Clothing & Groceries attract the highest-spending customers.**  
**Long-term customers (8+ years) show a decline in spending, suggesting engagement drop-offs.**  

 **Business Implications:**  
- Younger, lower-income customers tend to spend impulsively – brands can target them with trend-driven campaigns.  
- Home & Garden brands may need seasonal promotions to increase engagement.  
- Loyalty programs could help prevent drop-offs after Year 8.
