# Customer Spending & Segmentation Analysis – Tableau Dashboard  

## Objective  
Analyze customer spending patterns based on **income levels, product preferences, and retention trends** to provide actionable business insights.  

---

## Key Insights from the Dashboard  

**Low-income customers (<20 years old) have the highest spending score (57.3), while high-income customers (Above 40) spend the least (45.6).**  
**Clothing & Groceries attract the highest-spending customers.**  
**Long-term customers (8+ years) show a decline in spending, suggesting engagement drop-offs.**  

 **Business Implications:**  
- Younger, lower-income customers tend to spend impulsively – brands can target them with trend-driven campaigns.  
- Home & Garden brands may need seasonal promotions to increase engagement.  
- Loyalty programs could help prevent drop-offs after Year 8.
